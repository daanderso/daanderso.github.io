<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<article>
<h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>My name is Derek Anderson. I am currently attending an intense boot camp to learn java and full stack software development. I wanted to enhance my skills and I wanted a software development background as a foundation. Formerly, I worked for a hardware/software vendor where I supported enterprise systems and system administrators. I was limited to certain technologies and I wanted to learn more. Iâ€™d like to use my problem solving background and newly acquired development background to collaborate with others and pursue a career in software development.

  		<h2>Virtual Pet</h2>
  		<p>Meet Drago the Dragon. Drago is a <a href="https://github.com/daanderso/Virtual-Pet">Virtual Pet.</a> You may feed him, play with him, give him water and he sometimes needs rest. Once Drago's needs reach 50 he will start to need more attention. Drago has a mind of his own sometimes so he may feed himself, drink, entertain himself, or take a nap. Lastly, be careful when any of Drago's needs get close to 100. If you wait too long to address them he can tragically pass away. There is a lot displayed on the console after time advances so you may need to scroll up to see all the details.</p>
